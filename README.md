# 🗄️ MySQL Practice Log  

A growing collection of MySQL queries documenting my learning journey as I build a solid foundation in SQL.  
This repository contains both **SQL So Far (Part 1)** and **SQL So Far (Part 2)** — representing everything I’ve learned across two stages of SQL fundamentals.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Covers  

### **Part 1 – SQL Foundations**
- Basic data selection with `SELECT`
- Filtering using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Comparison operators (`=`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, etc.)
- Sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Limiting results with `LIMIT`
- Creating tables from scratch
- Understanding data types and constraints  
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records  
- Debugging SQL errors and understanding SQL execution flow  

---

### **Part 2 – Intermediate SQL Concepts**
Part 2 builds on the foundation from Part 1 and focuses on deeper SQL logic:

#### 🔹 **Aggregation Functions**
- `COUNT()`
- `SUM()`
- `AVG()`
- `MIN()`
- `MAX()`

These functions allow for summarizing data and generating meaningful insights.

#### 🔹 **GROUP BY**
Learning how MySQL groups rows into categories and how to aggregate within those groups.

#### 🔹 **HAVING Clause**
Filtering aggregated results (something `WHERE` cannot do).  
Examples include:
- Filtering group results by totals  
- Combining `HAVING` with aggregate functions  
- Performing grouped comparisons  

#### 🔹 **Additional Concepts Covered**
- Understanding grouped filtering vs. row-level filtering  
- Using `GROUP BY` with multiple columns  
- Using `ORDER BY` with grouped queries  
- Building queries step-by-step for clarity  

This part included creating new tables completely from scratch, which helped me fully understand how data is structured and why SQL behaves the way it does.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository  

This repository serves as:  
- A personal SQL learning log  
- A reference point for best practices  
- A step-by-step journey from zero to intermediate SQL  
- A foundation for future work in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI**

Each file represents real practice, mistakes, debugging, and understanding — not just theory.

## 🛠 Tools Used  

- **MySQL**  
- **MySQL Workbench**  

---

## 📁 Files Included  

- **SQL So Far.sql**  
- **SQL So Far Part 2.sql**  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  

With the foundation of SQL complete, the next phase will focus on:
- Applying SQL in data science workflows  
- Connecting SQL with Python (Pandas + MySQL connectors)  
- Building machine learning-ready datasets  
- Beginning the AI roadmap (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Linear Algebra, etc.)
